This is a small application built using Flask, Streamlit, and Weaviate to help familiarize myself with vector databases, with a special focus on Weaviate.

This application provides a simple interface to interact with a Weaviate database by using Flask as the backend and Streamlit for the frontend. Users can upload a photo and the application identifies the most similar image.
